	`AM_CPPFLAGS = -I$(top_srcdir)/src'.

2000-12-15  [ Ela ]  <ela@lkcc.org>

	* Release of version 0.0.19: Last known to include the Quake III
	license server which we are going to drop due to legacy reasons
	and the support of commercial software which is not the aim
	of the GNU project.

2000-12-06  Martin Grabmueller  <mgrabmue@cs.tu-berlin.de>

	configure script still usable for cross compilers.

	library "libresolv.so" on Solaris.

2000-06-21  [ Ela ]  <ela@lkcc.org>

	* configure.in: Added check for typedef off_t.
	This is used with sendfile().

2000-06-20  [ Ela ]  <ela@lkcc.org>

	[dynamically linked] or build our own from the source distribution
	[statically linked]. If mgrabmue provides a 'sizzle-config link-static'
	we can statically link against a already installed sizzle.

2000-06-13  [ Ela ]  <ela@lkcc.org>

	* configure.in: Dropped AWCS_MASTER_PIPE feature because this is
	now part of the general server concept.

	for some compiler switches.

	wsock32 and the feature --enable-http-proto.

1999-12-17  [ RAIMI ]  <raimi@lkcc.org>

	log_printf() in #if/#endifs.

	Fixed check for vsprintf() and vsnprintf().  Now configure does
	abort if no vsprintf() is available, and give a warning if
	vsnprintf() is emulated by the unsafe vsprintf().
