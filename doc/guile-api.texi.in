@c This file includes the documentation about the guile servers. It is
@c included by `serveez.texi'.

This section describes the guile interface of serveez meant to provide
the ability to exceptionally write servers with guile. Of course you could
do this without any help of serveez, but it makes it a lot easier. The
guile interface of serveez reduces the guile implementation of an Internet
server to a simple data processor.

@subsubsection Special data types

Serveez extends guile by various new data types which represent internal
data structures of serveez's core API.

@itemize @bullet
@item @code{#<svz-servertype>}
represent a server type.
@item @code{#<svz-server>}
represents a server (an instance of a server type).
@item @code{#<svz-socket>}
represents a socket structure.
@end itemize

@subsubsection Passing binary data

The new binary data type (i.e. @code{#<binary>}) provides access to any
kind of unstructured data. It manages data exchange between guile and serveez
and the other way around. There are some converter functions for strings 
and lists which help to process this binary data in a more complex (guile'ish) 
way.

BINARY->STRING_DEFUN
STRING->BINARY_DEFUN
BINARY?_DEFUN
LIST->BINARY_DEFUN
BINARY->LIST_DEFUN
BINARY-SEARCH_DEFUN
BINARY-SET!_DEFUN
BINARY-REF_DEFUN
BINARY-LENGTH_DEFUN
BINARY-CONCAT_DEFUN
BINARY-SUBSET_DEFUN
