@chapter Introduction

The Serveez core library provides all of the functionality necessary in
order to write Internet protocol servers (currently TCP, UDP, ICMP and RAW
sockets), pipe servers (connection oriented via a pair of named pipes) and 
coservers in a portable way. All of the included servers coming with this
package are based upon this library. It encapsulates the native network and 
file system programming interface of different Unices and Windows systems.

The Serveez embedding manual and the API documentation will give the reader
an overview about how to use its core library.

@chapter Embedding Serveez

This chapter deals with embedding the Serveez core library into standalone
C/C++ applications and using it in order to write additional servers.

@section Compiling and linking

When you have installed a version of Serveez passing the @file{configure}
script the @code{$prefix} argument e.g. @samp{./configure --prefix=/usr/local}
you will find the @file{libserveez} library in @file{/usr/local/lib} and the
include headers in @file{/usr/local/include}. If you want to compile a C 
program using the Serveez API and link against the Serveez core library 
@code{libserveez}, which is @file{libserveez.so} at Unices and 
@file{libserveez.dll} at Windows systems, you need to tell the compiler and
linker where to find the headers and libraries.

Most C compilers you can use will understand the following command line 
options for this purpose. The @samp{-I} argument specifies the path to 
additional include headers, the @samp{-L} argument the path to additional 
libraries and the @samp{-l} argument the library itself to link against.

@example
$ cc svztest.c -I/usr/local/include -o svztest -L/usr/local/lib -lserveez
@end example

@node A simple example, , Compiling and linking, Embedding Serveez
@section A simple example

The following small example shows how to use the Serveez core library to
print the list of known network interface. As you will notice there are three
major steps to do: Include the library header with 
@code{#include <libserveez.h>}, initialize the library via @code{svz_boot()} 
and finalize it via @code{svz_halt()}. In between these calls you can use
all of the API functions, variables and macros described in 
@ref{Embedding API}. 

@example
#include <libserveez.h> /* Include the library header. */

int
main (int argc, char **argv)
@{
  svz_boot ();          /* Library initialization. */
  svz_interface_list ();
  svz_halt ();          /* Library finalization. */
  return 0;

@chapter Embedding API

In this chapter the reader will find a short description of each function,
global variable and macro the core library of Serveez provides. The API can
either be used to implement a new server or coserver module for use with
Serveez or for supporting network and server functionality within your own
applications without caring about the details and system programming.

Most of the Serveez core library interface functionality should be
prefixed with @code{svz_}. Small symbols will refer to functions and
variables in most cases and big letter symbols refer to macros.

@node Memory management, Data structures, , Embedding API
@section Memory management

The core library of Serveez is able to keep track of the memory an 
application or part of a program consumes and also controls itself in the
same manner. When you are using this memory allocator interface you can
determine and afterwards remove memory leaks. This is a very important
feature if you consider servers being long term programs.

The three allocator function pointers for @code{malloc()}, @code{realloc()}
and @code{free()} make it possible to instruct Serveez to use different
kinds of memory, which might be necessary if you want the library to work
with shared memory arenas or any other underlying memory API.

@section Data structures

Since most servers need to store information about its clients or want to
keep track of data during runtime we implemented some of the most useful
data pools. The actual aim was to provide higher level data structures which
the programming language C does not support. Some of the included servers
which come with Serveez make extensive use of them.

@node Array, Hashtable, , Data structures
@subsection Array functions

The array data structure is a simple array implementation. Each array has got
a size and capacity. The array indices range from zero to the arrays size 
minus one. You can put any kind of data into this array which fits into the
size of a pointer. The array automatically grows if necessary.

@node Hashtable, Sparsevector, Array, Data structures
@subsection Hashtable functions

A hashtable associates keys of arbitrary size and content with values. 
This data structure is also called associative array sometimes because you 
use keys in order to access values instead of numbers. You cannot store 
two values associated with the same key. The values can have any simple 
C types like integers or pointers.

@subsection Sparsevector functions

A sparse vector is a kind of data array which grows and shrinks on demand. 
It unifies the advantages of chained lists (less memory usage than simple 
arrays) and arrays (faster access to specific elements). This implementation 
can handle gaps in between the array elements.

@subsection Vectorlist functions

A vector list is an array of memory chunks with a fixed size. It
holds copies of the values you added to the vector list. When deleting
or inserting an element the indices of the following elements get
either decremented or incremented. This data structure is especially useful
if you actually want to forget about the pointers you put into it for it

@section Client connections

Serveez tries to handle all kinds of Internet protocols like TCP (connection
oriented), UDP, ICMP and RAW (packet oriented) and communication across
named pipes (also connection oriented) in the same way. Therefore it uses
a structure called @code{svz_socket_t} which is the abstraction of any kind
of communication endpoint (can be client or server or both together).

@end menu

@node TCP sockets, Pipe connections, , Client connections
@subsection TCP sockets

TCP sockets provide a reliable, stream oriented, full duplex connection 
between two sockets on top of the Internet Protocol (IP). TCP guarantees 
that the data arrives in order and retransmits lost packets. It generates 
and checks a per packet checksum to catch transmission errors. TCP does 
not preserve record boundaries.

@node Pipe connections, UDP sockets, TCP sockets, Client connections
@subsection Pipe connections

The pipe implementations supports both named and anonymous pipes. Pipe
servers are implemented as listeners on a file system FIFO on Unices or
"Named Pipes" on Windows (can be shared over a Windows network).

A FIFO special file is similar to a pipe, except that it is created in a 
different way. Instead of being an anonymous communications channel,
a FIFO special file is entered into the file system.

Once you have created a FIFO special file in this way, any process can open 
it for reading or writing, in the same way as an ordinary file. However, 
it has to be open at both ends simultaneously before you can proceed to do
any input or output operations on it.

@subsection ICMP sockets

The ICMP socket implementation is currently used in the tunnel server which
comes with the Serveez package. It implements a user protocol receiving and
sending ICMP packets by opening a raw socket with the protocol IPPROTO_ICMP.

The types of ICMP packets passed to the socket can be filtered using the 
ICMP_FILTER socket option (or by software as done here). ICMP packets are 
always processed by the kernel too, even when passed to a user socket.

@node Raw sockets, , ICMP sockets, Client connections
@subsection Raw sockets

A raw socket receives or sends the raw datagram not including link 
level headers. It is currently used by the ICMP socket implementation of
the core library. The IPv4 layer generates an IP header when sending a packet 
unless the IP_HDRINCL socket option is enabled on the socket. When it is 
enabled, the packet must contain an IP header. For receiving the IP header
is always included in the packet.

Only processes with an effective userid of 0 (Administrator or root) or the
CAP_NET_RAW capability are allowed to open raw sockets. All packets or errors
matching the protocol number specified for the raw socket are passed to 
this socket. A protocol of IPPROTO_RAW implies enabled IP_HDRINCL and
receives all IP protocols. Sending is not allowed.

@section Coserver functions

The following section describes the internal coserver interface of serveez. 
Coservers are helper processes meant to perform blocking tasks. This is
going to be necessary because serveez itself is single threaded. Each 
coserver is connected via a pair of pipes to the main thread of serveez 
communicating over a simple text line protocol. Each request/response is 
seperated by a newline character.

If the user wants to use these processes you need to start the coserver
interface by calling @code{svz_coserver_init()} once before entering the
main server loop and shut it down afterwards by calling 
@code{svz_coserver_finalize()}.

As already noted in the main serveez manual a server type is the 
main specification of the abilities and configuration items of a server
which can be instantiated. It is represented by the C structure
@code{svz_servertype_t} in serveez. It contains server specific members 
like its name, different callbacks, a single default configuration and a 
list of configuration items which determines what can be configured.

This paragraph describes the main server loop functionality. There two modes
of operation. The default mode as used in serveez is to jump into the loop
and waiting until the core library drops out of it. The user can also tell
the serveez core library to pass its socket chain once and return 
immediately. Thus you are able to issue additional functionality in between
each pass if you cannot handle this within the timers (notifiers) of servers

@section Port configurations

A port configuration is a structure defining a network or file system
configuration. Depending on the type of a server it can be bound to one
or more port configurations. There are two major types of port 
configurations: connection and packet oriented protocol port configurations.
TCP and PIPE configurations are connection oriented and ICMP, UDP and 
RAW configurations are packet oriented.

Serveez holds a list of port configurations. Each configuration is 
identified by its name. When you bind a server to a port configuration it
does not get bound to a certain name but to its content. If there are two
or more port configuration specifying the same network or file system 
configuration just a single one gets actually used.

@section Boot functions

This section contains the description of some runtime checkable flags 
indicating the abilities of the running serveez core API and the underlying
operating system. It also describes the most important functions 
@code{svz_boot()} and @code{svz_halt()} which must be the first and the last
call to the core API.

@section Network interface functions

The network interface functions of the serveez core API allow the access
to the network devices on your system. The system administrator can setup
these devices to be bound to different Internet addresses and thereby split
the network configuration into different "domains". Thus the system is able
to separate traffic of different networks. If setup correctly serveez can
follow these rules.

@section Useful Windows functions

Serveez is meant to run on Windows systems as well (with some restrictions
of course). The following functions come up with the Windows implementation
of the serveez core API only. They allow access to the Windows registry 
database and some other useful things.

SVZ_WINDOZE_START_DAEMON_DEFUN
SVZ_WINDOZE_STOP_DAEMON_DEFUN
SVZ_WINDOZE_ASC2UNI_DEFUN
