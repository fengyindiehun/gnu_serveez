Bug:	     B0015
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2000-09-20
Description: The named pipes on Win32 do not work properly yet.

Bug:	     B0014
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2000-09-20
Description: Serveez does not run on i64 Linux.

Bug:	     B0013
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2000-09-12
Description: Bigger CGI scripts under Win95 will lock the server. Bigger
	     means more content production here. This happened with batch
	     files (.bat) which `type file.txt'.

Bug:	     B0012
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2000-09-12
Description: If the server has many open connections and much traffic on
	     these Linux starts deadlocking for some reason. This 
	     collaborates with the occurence of EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN on
	     network sockets. Seems like if one socket starts with this
	     all want to do the same: nothing, but wasting time in kernel
	     space. Errors happen to be on outgoing connections only.

Bug:	     B0011
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2000-09-12
Description: On some Linux's the named pipe behaviour is not as it is
	     documented. See `man 4 fifo' for more information.

Description: ident coserver dies because of queue overrun. thus the
	     socket references cannot get decreased.

Date:	     1999-10-27
Description: segmentation fault das passiert wenn ein bot oder
	     operator connected und auf diesem port die
	     floodprotection ausgemacht werden soll... (vermutl. denn
	     das ist es was die connects gemeinsam haben). Normale
