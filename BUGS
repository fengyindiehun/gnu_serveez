Bug:	     B0017
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed
Date:	     2000-11-11
Description: There is no standard raw socket support in the Winsock API.
	     Maybe we should use the ICMP.DLL API instead ? 
Fix:	     Noticed that the above DLL is unusable for our purposes.
	     Windows 2000 is said to support raw sockets like any other Unix
	     but it is *not* well known to work properly.

Bug:	     B0016
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (2000-11-11/ela)
Date:	     2000-11-04
Description: The Winsock API cannot sendto() or recvfrom() "connected"
	     UDP and ICMP sockets. The calls return with "Socket is already
	     connected". Thus the tunnel server will not work properly.
Fix:	     Use of send() and recv() instead of their -to() and -from()
	     versions.

Bug:	     B0015
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2000-09-20
Description: The named pipes on Win32 do not work properly yet.

Bug:	     B0014
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (2000-10-01/mgrabmue)
Date:	     2000-09-20
Description: Serveez does not run on i64 Linux.
Fix:	     Made minor changes to the Sizzle core library (garbage 
	     collection).

Bug:	     B0013
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (2000-10-03/ela)
Date:	     2000-09-12
Description: Bigger CGI scripts under Win95 will lock the server. Bigger
	     means more content production here. This happened with batch
	     files (.bat) which `type file.txt'.
Fix:	     Pipes have been done non-blocking via PeekNamedPipe() in the
	     Win32 port.

Bug:	     B0012
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       unfixed
Date:	     2000-09-12
Description: If the server has many open connections and much traffic on
	     these Linux starts deadlocking for some reason. This 
	     collaborates with the occurrence of EWOULDBLOCK or EAGAIN on
	     network sockets. Seems like if one socket starts with this
	     all want to do the same: nothing, but wasting time in kernel
	     space. Errors happen to be on outgoing connections only.

Bug:	     B0011
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (2000-09-22/ela)
Date:	     2000-09-12
Description: On some Linux's the named pipe behavior is not as it is
	     documented. See `man 4 fifo' for more information.
Fix:	     Checking for the file flags (S_ISFIFO) of a previously created
	     named pipe. This has been a problem on NFS mounts.

Bug:	     B0010
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (2000-08-20/ela)
Date:	     2000-08-19
Description: Ident coserver dies because of queue overrun. Thus the
	     socket references cannot get decreased.
Fix:	     Using a general coserver request hash instead of socket
	     structure references.

Bug:	     B0009
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (2000-07-06/raimi)
Date:	     2000-06-21
Description: Filesize 0 (zero) for http files is not handled specifically.
             HTTP directory listing does not show the actual directory.
Fix:	     Added some extra code for this.

Bug:         B0008
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (2000-11-11/ela)
Date:	     2000-04-24
Description: Http cache inconsistency.
Fix:         With help of a special paranoid checking function all bugs
	     have been caught. 

Bug:         B0007
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (1999-11-18/ela)
Date:	     1999-10-27
Description: accept() fails under Cygwin with a "bad address" error.

Bug:         B0006
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (1999-11-18/ela)
Date:	     1999-10-27
Description: accept() fails under SunOS 5.6 with a "bad address" error.

Bug:         B0005
From:	     ela <stefan@lkcc.org>
State:       fixed (1999-10-27/mgrabmue)
Date:	     1999-10-27
Description: Disabling floodprotection on port <vielzuhohezahl> ... War
	     vermutlich derselbe Fehler, in der 4er ist das bloss nicht
	     gestorben.

Bug:         B0004
From:	     raimi <raimi@cs.tu-berlin.de>
State:       fixed (1999-10-27/mgrabmue)
Date:	     1999-10-27
Description: segmentation fault das passiert wenn ein bot oder
	     operator connected und auf diesem port die
	     floodprotection ausgemacht werden soll... (vermutl. denn
	     das ist es was die connects gemeinsam haben). Normale
	     connects scheinen zu gehen.

Bug:         B0003
From:	     mgrabmue <mgrabmue@cs.tu-berlin.de>
State:       fixed (1999-10-25/mgrabmue)
Date:	     1999-10-21
Description: Serveez sometimes segfaults when the massclient
	     disconnects.

Bug:         B0002
From:	     mgrabmue <mgrabmue@cs.tu-berlin.de>
State:       fixed (1999-10-25/mgrabmue)
Date:	     1999-10-21
Description: Serveez goes into endless loop or something when many
	     massclients are connected.  Process uses 100% CPU and
	     does no accept connections anymore.

Bug:         B0001
From:	     mgrabmue <mgrabmue@cs.tu-berlin.de>
State:       fixed (1999-10-21/raimi)
Date:	     1999-10-19
Description: Perl master server dies after a while when more than four
	     massclients connect.
