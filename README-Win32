Introduction
============

   This is the README for the native Win32 port of this package. It uses 
the original M$ Visual C++ compiler to create both the serveez library 
and the actual serveez binary. Of course, the Cygwin and MinGW32 port via 
the gcc for Win32 is still supported, but it seems to be much better to
do it this way. You will need at least version 5.0 of this compiler. 
Higher versions do convert the projects automatically.

Installation
============

   Unpack the package archive of serveez to the directory `serveez/'. 
Then you need to copy some files to their native location.

$ copy config.h.serveez config.h
$ copy src\svzconfig.h.serveez src\svzconfig.h
$ copy version.h.serveez version.h

   If you have done these preperations you can open the serveez workspace
file `serveez.dsw' which contains both of the project files with the right
depedencies. There are generally two versions of the projects. These are
"Dbg" and "Opt". Choose either of the "Debug" or "Release" version of the
serveez project and compile. That's it. After all you will have the 
`serveez.exe' binary which depends on the `libserveez.dll'.

   All of the prebuild `version.h's and `config.h's have been created with
a current Cygwin installation. You might create them on your own if you want
to, but this is optional. You just need to adjust the paths.

$ c:\Programme\DevStudio\VC\bin\VCVARS32.BAT
$ set PATH=%PATH%;c:\Programme\cygwin\bin
$ set CC=cl -D__MINGW32__ -D_WIN32
$ set LD=link
$ sh configure --disable-debug

ela.
