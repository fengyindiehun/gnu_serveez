README-Win32 for GNU Serveez

See end for copying conditions.


Introduction
============

   This is the README for the native Win32 port of this package.  It uses
the original M$ Visual C++ compiler to create both the Serveez library
and the actual Serveez binary.  You will need at least version 5.0 of this
compiler (higher versions do convert the projects automatically).  Of course,
the Cygwin and MinGW32 port via the gcc for Win32 is still supported, but it
seems to be much better to do it this way.

Installation
============

   First unpack the package archive of Serveez to the directory `serveez/'.
Then you need to copy some files to their native location.  The `vcgen.bat'
batch file (invoked from the top-level directory) does this for you.

    $ copy config.h.serveez config.h
    $ copy src\svzconfig.h.serveez src\svzconfig.h
    $ copy src\libserveez\svzpath.h.serveez src\libserveez\svzpath.h

   If you have done these preperations you can open the Serveez workspace
file `serveez.dsw' which contains both of the project files with the right
depedencies.  There are generally two versions of the projects: "Dbg" and
"Opt".  Choose either of the "Debug" or "Release" version of the Serveez
project and compile.  That's it!  After this you will have the `serveez.exe'
binary which depends on the `libserveez.dll'.

   All of the prebuild files (like `config.h') have been created with
a current Cygwin installation.  You wish to create them yourself, but this
is optional.  You just need to adjust the paths.

    $ c:\Programme\DevStudio\VC\bin\VCVARS32.BAT
    $ set PATH=%PATH%;c:\Programme\cygwin\bin
    $ set CC=cl -D__MINGW32__ -D_WIN32
    $ set LD=link
    $ sh configure --disable-debug --host=mingw32 --build=mingw32


Requirements
============

  Serveez also depends on the GNU packages bzip2, zlib and Guile.  You
should install these packages somewhere the compiler can find the include
headers and libraries.  Binary packages built with the M$ Visual C++
compiler can be obtained at <http://www.lkcc.org/~ela/devel.html#gnu>
and the packages for the MinGW32 gcc toolchain can be obtained at
<http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/mingwrep>.
