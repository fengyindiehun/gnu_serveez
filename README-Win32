Introduction
============

   This is the README for the native Win32 port of this package. It uses 
the original M$ Visual C++ compiler to create both the sizzle library 
and the actual serveez binary. Of course, the Cygwin and MinGW port via 
the gcc for Win32 is still supported, but it seems to be much better to
do it this way.

Files
=====

README-Win32     - this file
serveez.dsw      - the serveez workspace file
serveez.dsp      - the serveez project file
config.h.serveez - prebuild config.h for serveez
libsizzle.dsp    - sizzle library project file
config.h.sizzle  - prebuild config.h for the sizzle library

Installation
============

   Unpack both of the package archives of serveez and sizzle to the 
directories `serveez/' and `sizzle/'. Then you need to copy some files to
their native location.

$ copy config.h.serveez config.h
$ copy config.h.sizzle ..\sizzle\config.h
$ copy libsizzle.dsp ..\sizzle\libsizzle

   If you have done these preperations you can open the serveez workspace
file `serveez.dsw' which contains both of the project files with the right
depedencies. There are generally two versions of the projects. These are
"Dbg" and "Opt". Compile. That's it. After all you will have the 
`serveez.exe' which depends on the `sizzle.dll'.
