README for GNU Serveez

See end for copying conditions.


Description
===========

Serveez is a server framework.  It provides routines and help for
implementing IP based servers (currently TCP, UDP and ICMP).  It is also
possible to use named pipes for all connection oriented protocols.

We think it is worth the effort because many people need server functionality
within their applications.  However, many people experience problems
with ‘select’- or ‘poll’-loops, and with non-blocking operations.

This application demonstrates various aspects of advanced network
programming in a portable manner.  It is known to compile and run on
GNU/Linux systems, as well as on other 32-bit and 64-bit flavours of Unix
and on Microsoft Windows (9x/ME/NT/2000/XP).

You can use it for implementing your own servers or for understanding how
certain network services and operations work.

The package includes a number of servers that work already: an HTTP server,
an IRC server, a Gnutella spider and some others.  One of the highlights is
that you can run all protocols on the same port.  The application itself is
single threaded but it uses helper processes for concurrent name resolution
and ident lookups.


Requirements
============

Serveez needs GNU Guile (Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions).
This current version is known to work with Guile 1.3 and later.


Installation
============

See INSTALL for general instructions on configuring and building Serveez.
See the manual (doc/serveez.info) chapter "Using Serveez", for details on
the various options you can pass to the configure script, apart from the
usual options for customizing the installation directories (.e.g, --prefix).

If you have problems building the package out of the box, this may be due
to GNU libtool's inability to handle dynamic linking for your platform.
In that case, try reconfiguring with `--disable-shared'.

Installation populates the following directories (creating them first,
if necessary) with various files:

 $(bindir)     -- executables: serveez, serveez-config, mkpassword
 $(mandir)     -- manpages: serveez(1), serveez-config(1)
 $(includedir) -- libserveez.h
                  svzconfig.h
                  libserveez/*.h (includes subdirs and headers)
 $(libdir)     -- libserveez shared object + libtool support file(s)
 $(infodir)    -- manuals: serveez-api.info, serveez.info
 $(pkgdatadir) -- scheme (*.scm) files implementing guile servers

Before installing, consider doing "make check" and reporting any errors
or strangeness you might encounter to bug-serveez (at gnu dot org).


Getting the latest source
=========================

You can always get the latest Serveez source from our public repository.
Please use an official release if you want to work with Serveez.  The
source from the repository might not even compile.

    $ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/serveez.git

Run `sh autogen.sh' (see comments for prerequisite tools) to bootstrap.
Also, you might need to configure with `--enable-maintainer-mode'.
