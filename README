Requirements
============

serveez needs Martin Grabmueller's sizzle language. this version is known
to work with sizzle-0.0.27.


Installation
============

Unpack the distribution tarball:

$ tar xzf serveez-<version>.tar.gz                  (using GNU tar)
$ gzip -cd ../serveez-<version>.tar.gz | tar xf -   (using another tar)
  
Change into the source directory:

$ cd serveez-<version>   
  
Configure the source package for your system.
We recommend to use --enable-opt unless you have a good reason not to do so.

$ ./configure --enable-opt --with-sizzle=../sizzle-<version>

The latter option specifies the path to the sizzle source distribution.
Now, compile the package:

$ make
  
Install serveez.

$ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location /usr/local or in any location that is only writable by root.

For further information on installing the package, please consult the
file INSTALL, included in this distribution.


Getting the latest CVS snapshot
===============================

You can always get the latest serveez version from our cvs repository.
Please use an official release if you want to work with serveez. The cvs
version might not even compile.

cvs -d :pserver:anoncvs@lkcc.pinuts.de:/home/cvs/cvsroot -z 9 co serveez

The password is 'anoncvs'. Run sh autogen.sh and configure with appropriate
