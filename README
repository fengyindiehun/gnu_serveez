README for GNU Serveez

See end for copying conditions.


Description
===========

Serveez is a server framework.  It provides routines and help for
implementing IP based servers (currently TCP, UDP and ICMP).  It is also
possible to use named pipes for all connection oriented protocols.

We think it is worth the effort because many people need server functionality
within their applications.  However, many people experience problems
with select()- or poll()-loops, and with non-blocking operations.

This application demonstrates various aspects of advanced network
programming in a portable manner.  It is known to compile and run on
GNU/Linux systems, as well as on other 32-bit and 64-bit flavours of Unix
and on Microsoft Windows (9x/ME/NT/2000/XP).

You can use it for implementing your own servers or for understanding how
certain network services and operations work.

The package includes a number of servers that work already: an HTTP server,
an IRC server, a Gnutella spider and some others.  One of the highlights is
that you can run all protocols on the same port.  The application itself is
single threaded but it uses helper processes for concurrent name resolution
and ident lookups.


Requirements
============

Serveez needs GNU Guile (Ubiquitous Intelligent Language for Extensions).
This current version is known to work with Guile 1.3 and later.


Installation
============

Unpack the distribution tarball:

    $ tar xvzf serveez-<version>.tar.gz               (using GNU tar)
    $ gzip -cd serveez-<version>.tar.gz | tar xvf -   (using another tar)

Change into the source directory:

    $ cd serveez-<version>

Configure the source package for your system:
We recommend to use --enable-opt unless you have a good reason not to do so.

    $ ./configure --enable-opt

Now compile the package:

    $ make

Install Serveez:

    $ make install

You must have root privileges if you want to install the package in the
standard location (/usr/local) or in any location that is only writable
by root.

If you have problems building the package out of the box, this is due to
GNU libtool's inability to handle dynamic linking in most cases.  That is
why we recommend to try and configure the package with `--disable-shared'
and/or the native compiler (if any).

For further information on installing the package, please consult the
section "Using Serveez" in the manual, and the file INSTALL included in
this distribution.


Getting the latest source
=========================

You can always get the latest Serveez source from our public repository.
Please use an official release if you want to work with Serveez.  The
source from the repository might not even compile.

    $ git clone git://git.sv.gnu.org/serveez.git

Run `sh autogen.sh' (see comments for prerequisite tools) to bootstrap.
Also, you might need to configure with `--enable-maintainer-mode'.
