Here are listed all the hackers who helped creating this package:

John Fitzgerald <jcf@wave.co.nz> for giving an idea about ASN.1 (Abstract
	Syntax Notation One), PDU (Protocol Data Unit) and LER (List 
	Encoding Rule) resulting in the "Binary Smob".

Martin Grabmueller <mgrabmue@cs.tu-berlin.de> for writing the initial
	version and keep accepting bug report and patches for Sizzle
	which we were using for configuration file parsing.
	Thanks for giving information about how to embed Guile into
	Serveez and use it as configuration file parser.
	Also for implementing the guile servers and helping to convince
	the guile people keeping the guile distribution portable to Win32.

Martin Rother <m.rother@berlin.de> for supplying working Windows
	installations (2k, NT and 98) and testing on these platforms.

	diff'ing ela's and his patches.
	Kudos for the Cygwin port go to both Raimi and Ela.
	Thanks also for bugging me to keep this stuff up.
	
Stefan Jahn <stefan@lkcc.org> for debugging and trying

	bug and submitting a patch for it.
