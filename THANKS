Here are listed all the hackers who helped me with this package.

Raimund Jacob <raimi@cs.tu-berlin.de> for a patch that made the whole
	beast working and heavy debugging and testing.  Also for brave
	diff'ing ela's and his patches.
	Kudos for the Cygwin port go to both Raimi and Ela.
	Thanks also for bugging me to keep this stuff up.
	
Stefan Jahn <stefan@linux.f1.fhtw-berlin.de> for debugging and trying
	this crap under cygwin.  Also for finding the weird accept()
	bug and submitting a patch for it.
	For speeding up request handling and bug hunting.
	Kudos for the Cygwin port go to both Ela and Raimi.
