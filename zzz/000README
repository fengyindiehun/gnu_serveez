This directory contains reading material for insomniacs.
It and its contents are not included in the distribution.

The file names have the form:

  YYYY-MM-DD.TITLE

In the text, the notation $ee means "root of source tree".
Emacs will visit that file with ‘M-x ffap’ if you define the
env var, e.g.:

  (setenv "ee" "~/build/GNU/serveez")

Happy snoozing!
