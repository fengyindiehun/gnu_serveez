HACKING GNU Serveez					-*- org -*-

This file is both a guide for newcomers and a todo list for oldstayers.
It lives in the repo but is not included in the distribution.
See the end for copying conditions.

*** Minimize memory consumption of coservers.
*** Find out how to unload a shared library on MacOS.
*** Keep track of network interface changes.
*** Make some of the configure-time servers available dynamically at run-time.
*** Resolve libcoserver problem (some linkers swallow syms because they are not needed in libserveez).
*** Runtime check for sendfile() (4 vs 7 args) in configure script.
*** How can a self connected Gnutella socket find out its port configuration for sending push requests and replies?
*** Implement a DNS server for home networks.

*** Prefix the #define's in 'svzconfig.h' by 'SVZ_' to avoid clashes with other applications.
*** Let the user create network device bindings.
*** Allow INADDR_ANY bindings again with all consequences.
*** Document compilation hints (--disable-shared, static guile, ...)

  working. (1999-10-21/mgrabmue)

*** no trailing whitespace
*** untabify
*** ChangeLog / VCS log
***** normally
      ChangeLog entries should match VCS log entries in the body.
      The canonical form for a VCS entry is:

        TITLE

        SHORT-PARAGRAPH

        ENTRY-CONVENTIONS
        * FILE (FUNC): DESCRIPTION.

      There are two newlines between TITLE and SHORT-PARAGRAPH, and in
      between SHORT-PARAGRAPH and ENTRY-CONVENTIONS, both of which are
      optional (if both are omitted, omit also the two newlines between
      them, leaving only two newlines between TITLE and the rest of the
      entry).  TITLE is one line only.

      This format is a superset of the GNU Coding Standards
      (info "(standards) Change Logs"), which does not provide for
      SHORT-PARAGRAPH or ENTRY-CONVENTIONS, and considers TITLE to
      be optional.

      Most information about the change should be placed in the source
      code comments.  SHORT-PARAGRAPH is for referencing bug reports,
      giving credit (i.e., "Reported by" and "Suggested by" blurbs),
      and pointers to the origin of regressions (using conventional
      format "Regression introduced YYYY-MM-DD [TITLE].")

      ENTRY-CONVENTIONS describe entry-specific abbreviations or
      implicitly shared descriptions.  For example, instead of this:

        * foo.c: #include "header.h".
        (foo): Use ‘func’.
        * bar.c: #include "header.h".
        (bar, baz): Use ‘func’.
        (qux): Update call to ‘bar’.
        * doc.texi (ref): Mention "header.h".

      you can write this:

        Here, all C files now #include "header.h";
        "U" means "Use ‘func’".
        * foo.c (foo): U.
        * bar.c (bar, baz): U.
        (qux): Update call to ‘bar’.
        * doc.texi (ref): Mention "header.h".

      In this particular example, you can also write:

        Here, all C files now #include "header.h".
        * foo.c (foo): Use ‘func’.
        * bar.c (bar, baz): Likewise.
        (qux): Update call to ‘bar’.
        * doc.texi (ref): Mention "header.h".

***** entries titled with suffix "; nfc."
      Some changes don't merit an entry in ChangeLog; for those, simply
      append "; nfc." (non-fruitful change) to the TITLE to mark that
      its omission from the ChangeLog is intentional.  You can omit
      other sections if you wish.  For example, here is a one line
      (TITLE only) entry:

      [maint] Add top-level file HACKING; nfc.

***** conventions for TITLE
******* tag
	To help identify the area of the change, include one or more
	tags in square braces at the beginning of the TITLE.  For
	example, ‘maint’ for maintenance, ‘int’ for internal, ‘api’,
	‘guile’, etc.  Because space in the TITLE is limited, tags
	should be short and (if more than one) separated by a space.
	For example:

	[guile int] Avoid deprecated libguile elements.

******* globbing ok
	Unlike in the rest of the ChangeLog entry, you can use wildcards
	(globbing) in the TITLE.  This saves space.

******* normally, complete sentence; stylized, sometimes
	Use a complete sentence, in the same style as the DESCRIPTION
	part.  An exception to this is adding or deleting elements of
	some group, for which you can use "New" or "Removed" followed
	by "GROUP: ELEMENT,...".  Each ELEMENT should be left unquoted.
	Some examples, in normal/stylized pairs:

	[api] Add func ‘foo_bar_baz’.
	[api] New func: foo_bar_baz
	[int] Add bus commands ‘WAIT’, ‘PROBE’.
	[int] New bus commands: WAIT, PROBE
	[guile] Remove bindings ‘gh_car’, ‘gh_cdr’, ‘gh_list’.
	[guile] Removed 3 bindings: gh_*

	Note that the stylized example in the last pair uses globbing.

*** public non-‘master’ branches in the repo
***** ‘a’ -- "anchor", "asis", "already", "argh-just-leave-me-alone"
This branch is for what was already released.  It will never be rebased.
Its tip will always have a commit title starting with "Release".
***** ‘next’ -- stuff for the next release
This branch is work for the next release.  It will never be rebased.
***** q/TOPIC -- "questionably", "querulously"
These are experimental, exploring the particular TOPIC.  They are intended
to be ephemeral, undergoing rebase, amendment, and ultimately removal.
*** copyright policy
***** update every year, unconditionally
***** (if (< 2 (- END BEGIN)) RANGE INDIVIDUAL)
